shadowing
hoisting
closure


Variable Naming
- Name must start with alphabet
- It can be alpha numeric.
- It can start with "_" special character [only in development]
- Special characters are not recommended.
- Name can't have blank spaces.
- It can't be more than 255 chars.
- Name must speak what it is.
                class Employee => object => employee
- Better to use "camelCase" for names.
- It can't be a keyword.

Syntax:
            var  _productName;      => this is not final, it requires further implementation
            var  2023_sales;            // invalid
            var  sales_2023;            // valid

Global Scope:
- It configures variable at module level.
- So that variable is accessible to all functions in module.
- You can declare global variables by using the keywords : var, let and const.

Ex:
<script>
    var x = 10;                ]
    let y = 20;                ]        Global in access
    const z = 30;            ]

   function f1(){
        document.write("function 1 - <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>");
   }
   function f2(){
    document.write("function 2 - <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>");
   }
   f1();
   f2();
</script>

FAQ: How to define a global variable in function?
Ans: By using "window" object of javascript

Syntax:
        function f1(){
            window.a = 10;
        }

Ex:
<script>
    "use strict";
    var x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;

   function f1(){
        window.a = 100;
        document.write("function 1 - <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>a=" + a + "<br>");
   }
   function f2(){
    document.write("function 2 - <br> x=" + x + "<br>y=" + y + "<br>z=" + z + "<br>a=" + a);
   }
   f1();
   f2();
</script>
                                    Data Type
- In computer programming data type refers to "Data Structure". [DS]
- Data structure defines the type of data and its range.
- JavaScript is not a strongly typed language. you can't set restriction for type of value in a variable. But you can validate.
- JavaScript is implicitly typed language.
- The type is determined according to the value defined.

            var x;            x is undefined
            x = 10;        x is number
            x = true;        x is boolean
            x = "John";    x is string
 [It is also reffered as dynamic type]
- JavaScript Data Types are classified into 2 groups

    a) Primitive Types
    b) Non-Primtive Types

                                        Primitive Types
- They are Immutable types.
- They have a fixed range for value.
- The structure of value can't change.
- They are stored in memory stack [LIFO]
- JavaScript Primitive types
        a) number
        b) string
        c) boolean
        d) null
        e) undefined
        f) symbol
